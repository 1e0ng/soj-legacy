<h2>Problem</h2>
Two natural numbers a and b are chosen (1&lt;a&lt;b). Person M is told the multiple of a and b (a*b), and person S is told the sum of a and b (a+b). The discussion between M and S goes like this:<br>
M: I do not know the numbers a and b. <br>
S: I do not know them either, but I knew you would not know them.<br>
M: Now I know the numbers! <br>
S: Now I know them, too!<br>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file contains pairs of natural numbers x and y (2<=x&lt;y<=550), one pair per line. The input is guaranteed to be correct.

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each pair x, y, find all pairs of a and b, such that x<=a&lt;b<=y and that the given discussion is possible. Write these pairs in a single line, and finish that line with "no more pairs." if there are a and b found in the given range, or write simply "no pairs." if there are not. Separate the numbers of a pair with a comma, terminate each pair with a semi-colon, and separate different pairs with a blank after the semi-colon, as shown in the example below.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
2 10
2 20
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
no pairs.
4,13; no more pairs.
