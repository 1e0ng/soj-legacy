<h1>The Caterpillar</h1>
</center>

<I>Definition:</I>
A caterpillar is a particular kind of tree with the following property: 
there is a central chain such that each of the tree's nodes lie either on 
the central chain, or they are adjacent to that chain. Below there are 
shown two caterpillars. The darkened nodes indicate the chain. 
<CENTER><IMG src="177a.gif"></CENTER>
The chain is not necessarily unique. For example, another possible chain for the second 
caterpillar is 3-2-5-9.

<h2>Task</h2>
Given a caterpillar with N
nodes, write a program which labels the nodes with numbers from 1 to N such that: 
<LI>each label from 1 to N is used exactly once; 
<LI>no two edges in the tree have the same absolute value of the 
difference between the labels of their adjacent nodes.
<p>
For the second caterpillar above, a possible labeling is indicated below along 
with the corresponding differences on the edges:

<h2>Input</h2>
File name: <B>CP.IN </B><BR>
<B>Line 1</B>: N
<LI>one integer, the number of nodes; <BR><B>Lines 2..<I>N</I></B>: X Y 
<LI>two integers, separated by a blank, which are two adjacent nodes 
connected by an edge.
<p>
The input data is correct, and the input tree is a caterpillar.

<h2>Output</h2>
File name: <B>CP.OUT</B><BR>
<B>Line 1</B>: L<SUB>1</SUB> L<SUB>2</SUB> ... L<SUB>N</SUB>
<LI>N integers, separated by blanks, where L<SUB>i</SUB> represents the 
label associated with the node i.
<p>If there are multiple solutions,
only one is required. If no labeling is possible, the output file should 
contain only one line with the word: IMPOSSIBLE

<h2>Limits</h2>
<LI>2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000
