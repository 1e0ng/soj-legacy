<h1>Sum of one-sequence</h1>
</center>

<p>
We say that a sequence of integers is a <i>one-sequence</i> if the 
difference between any two consecutive numbers in this sequence
is 1 or -1 and its first element is 0. More precisely: 
[a<SUB>1</SUB>,a<SUB>2</SUB>,...,a<SUB>n</SUB>]
is a one-sequence if
<UL>
<LI>for any k, such that 1&lt=k&lt n  : |a<SUB>k</SUB>-a<SUB>k+1</SUB>| =1
 and
<LI> a<SUB>1</SUB>=0
</UL>

<h2>Task</h2>
Write a program that:
<UL>
<LI>reads  two integers describing the
    length of the sequence and the sum of its elements,
    from the text file SUM.IN;
<LI> finds a one-sequence of the given length whose elements sum up to the given value or 
    states that such a sequence does not exist;
<LI>  writes the result to the text file SUM.OUT.
</UL>

<h2>Input</h2>
In the first line of the text file SUM.IN there is a number
 n, such that 1&lt=n&lt=10 000, which is the number of elements in the
 sequence. In the second line there is a number S, which is the sum
 of the elements of the sequence, such that |S| &lt= 50 000 000.

<h2>Output</h2>
 In the first n lines of the text file SUM.OUT there should be
written n integers (one in each line) that are the elements of
the sequence (k-th element in the k-th line) whose sum is S
or the word NIE (which means NO in Polish) if such a sequence does
not exist.
